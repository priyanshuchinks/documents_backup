1. project support? So much aount of work.. had worked 12-13 many of the weeks when no one is the team was working so much.
Delivered things before timelines.
Since we dont have much on the team management front, so thought to do all those stuff.



2. why not redressal?
It went in redressal


Next steps:
1. So short team?


GG:

2. responsibilities for the next level

Lead HR stuff
Dev Area - 1. continue working with what i was doing
2. Advancement in SSIS

3. what will be my story board for this year wrt to milestone

I think this year is gonna be more difficult as covid has already impact min 6 months of business


I dont want to miss this chance. Really want to be on the scatterplot at the top corner.


Data validation - Received closures on half of the extracts. Whatever extracts require code changes that comes to me.



1.Closure of things
2.SSIS advancement



Feedback - Any instant fresh ideas doesn't come from my side.


Concern is basically dont have any opportunity for team management. Last year being a part of FIN, used to manage tasks for atleast Deepika and Mukund.
